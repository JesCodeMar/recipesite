                <li>1 1/2 cups white granulated sugar</li>
                <li>1/2 cup unsweetened cocoa powder</li>
                <li>1 1/2 teaspoons baking powder</li>
                <li>1/2 teaspoon salt</li>
                <li>1/3 cup vegetable oil</li>
                <li>1 large egg</li>
                <li>1 tablespoon pure vanilla extract</li>
                <li>3/4 cup milk</li>

            <h3>Instructions</h3>
            <ol>
                <li>Combine flour, sugar, cocoa powder, baking powder and salt in a large bowl. Whisk thoroughly to combine well.</li>
                <li>Add oil, egg, vanilla and milk to the flour mixture and beat well to combine, about 30 seconds. Pour in the boiling water (with the coffee), and mix until glossy. (Cake batter is thin in consistency.)</li>
                <li>Pour the cake batter into the prepared pan. Bake for about 40-45 minutes, or until a toothpick inserted in the centre of the chocolate cake comes out semi-clean with small amount of cake (not runny batter) on it due to the fudgy texture.</li>
                <li>Remove from oven and allow to cool for 20 minutes. Transfer cake from the pan to a wire rack and cool completely before frosting.</li>
            </ol>
